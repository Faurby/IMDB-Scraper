# IMDB Scraping

## Current status

This is a project regarding scraping IMDB via Python.

Currently it creates 2 files:

* `Episodes_IMDB_Ratings.csv` which holds all scraped information.
* `Average_Season_IMDB_Ratings.csv` which holds seasons average imdb rating.

## Future goals

* Visualization 
  * like this [project](https://github.com/isabellabenabaye/community-project)
* User friendly
  * Like a website where a user can search for series
  * Make it so user can also search for series title, instead of only series id.
  * Show picture and description of series (would help when searching for title, to see if correct series)
  * Dropdown of related titles when you search
